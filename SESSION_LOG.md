# PROJECT_SETUP Session Log

## Session: 2025-09-04 - Master Planning & Sprint Definition

### Session Start
- **Time**: 16:19 PST
- **Location**: `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP`
- **Goal**: Create perfect `/initproject` command with complete automation

---

## Actions Completed

### 1. Initial Testing & Verification
- ✅ Ran `/initproject` on PROJECT_SETUP
- ✅ Created `.devassist/` structure with project_setup-server.js
- ✅ Verified session creation in `.sessions/current.json`
- ✅ Confirmed DevAssist memory retrieval working
- ✅ Found cleanup agent at `.devassist/agents/cleanup.js`

### 2. Gap Analysis
Discovered critical missing features:
- ❌ Project-specific slash commands (e.g., `/veria-start`) not created
- ❌ Heartbeat exists but not integrated
- ❌ No automatic git push on session-end
- ❌ No continuous summary file
- ❌ Subagent verification not automated
- ❌ Commands in `.claude/commands/` not project-specific

### 3. Documentation Review
Read and analyzed:
- ✅ `README.md` - Overall project documentation
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions for Claude Code
- ✅ `devassist-project-setup.md` - Detailed isolation requirements
- ✅ `MCP_SERVERS.md` - MCP server configuration
- ✅ `devassist-isolation/SPRINT_TRACKER.md` - Previous sprint work
- ✅ `devassist-isolation/SPRINT_3_RESULTS.md` - Template-v2 achievements

### 4. Master Plan Creation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `MASTER_PLAN.md` with 5-sprint approach
- ✅ Defined "perfect" initialization criteria
- ✅ Documented all missing features
- ✅ Created clear success metrics

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Existing Assets
- **Template-v2** from Sprint 3 has enhanced DevAssist integration
- **SessionHeartbeat** class exists but unused
- **devassist-init** script has basic structure
- **Global DevAssist** works but isn't project-isolated

### 2. Critical Path
The main issue is that `/initproject` doesn't create project-specific slash commands. Need to:
1. Generate `.claude/commands/{project}-*.md` files
2. Use proper slash command format
3. Ensure commands appear after Claude Code restart

### 3. Architecture Understanding
```
Global Level: ~/.claude/commands/          # Global commands
Project Level: .claude/commands/           # Should have project-specific
MCP Level: .devassist/server.js           # Provides the functionality
```

## Next Steps for Restart

If you need to continue this work:

1. **Read these files first:**
   ```bash
   cat MASTER_PLAN.md
   cat SESSION_LOG.md
   ```

2. **Check current state:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .devassist/
   ls -la .claude/commands/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No project commands yet"
   ```

3. **Start Sprint 1:**
   - Focus on creating `.claude/commands/{project}-*.md` files
   - Use template-v2 from `devassist-isolation/template-v2/`
   - Update `devassist-init` script

4. **Key Implementation Files:**
   - `/Users/danielconnolly/bin/devassist-init` - Main init script
   - `/Users/danielconnolly/.claude/commands/initproject.md` - Slash command
   - `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Custom_MCP/DevAssist_MCP/` - Core DevAssist
   - `devassist-isolation/template-v2/` - Enhanced template

---

## Environment Status

### MCP Servers
- ✅ 9 Global servers configured
- ✅ DevAssist global instance working
- ✅ Project-specific MCP created but needs enhancement

### Key Paths
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP
DEVASSIST_MCP=/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Custom_MCP/DevAssist_MCP
TEMPLATE_V2=/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/devassist-isolation/template-v2
BIN_DIR=/Users/danielconnolly/bin
```

## Session Notes

### Important Insights
1. The `/initproject` command uses `mcp__devassist__initproject` which creates basic structure
2. Project-specific commands need to be in `.claude/commands/` not just as MCP tools
3. Template-v2 from Sprint 3 has most functionality but isn't integrated
4. Heartbeat, git operations, and continuous summaries all exist in code but aren't connected

### User Requirements
- "No mistakes" - Everything must work perfectly
- Complete automation - No manual steps
- Project isolation - Each project completely separate
- Slash commands must appear - `/veria-start` not just `/session-start`

---

## Session End
- **Time**: [Current Time]
- **Status**: Ready to implement Sprint 1
- **Next Action**: Create project-specific slash command generation
