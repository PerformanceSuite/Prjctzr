# Sprint 1 Quick Start Guide

## Objective
Create the foundation for project-isolated DevAssist instances with slash command support.

## Key Challenge
The main issue we're solving: **Making project-specific commands appear as slash commands in Claude Code while maintaining full DevAssist functionality.**

## Sprint 1 Action Plan

### Step 1: Research MCP Slash Commands (Day 1 Morning)
**Goal**: Understand how to properly register slash commands in MCP

**Actions**:
1. Study MCP SDK documentation for command registration
2. Analyze working MCP servers that have slash commands
3. Test different registration methods
4. Document findings

**Key Files to Examine**:
- `/Projects/Custom_MCP/DevAssist_MCP/index.js` - How DevAssist registers commands
- Other MCP servers in `~/.npm/_npx/` that work with slash commands

### Step 2: Create Server Template (Day 1 Afternoon)
**Goal**: Build reusable template for project servers

**Create**: `/PROJECT_SETUP/devassist-isolation/template/server.js`

```javascript
// Key requirements:
// 1. Import main DevAssist functionality
// 2. Override project-specific settings
// 3. Register project commands as slash commands
// 4. Maintain data isolation
```

### Step 3: Implement Command Registry (Day 1 Evening)
**Goal**: Build system to register and expose commands

**Create**: `/PROJECT_SETUP/devassist-isolation/template/commands/registry.js`

**Must Support**:
- Dynamic command registration
- Slash command metadata
- Parameter schemas
- Command descriptions

### Step 4: Test in Claude Code (Day 2 Morning)
**Goal**: Verify commands appear and work

**Test Process**:
1. Create test project with template
2. Configure in Claude Desktop config
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Check if commands appear with "/"
5. Test command execution

### Step 5: Fix Issues & Document (Day 2 Afternoon)
**Goal**: Resolve any issues and create documentation

**Tasks**:
- Fix any command discovery issues
- Ensure DevAssist inheritance works
- Document the solution
- Create setup instructions

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Have
1. âœ… Commands MUST appear as slash commands (not just tools)
2. âœ… Full DevAssist functionality must be inherited
3. âœ… Data must be isolated between projects
4. âœ… Commands must have project prefix (e.g., /veria-start)

### Should Have
1. ðŸ“‹ Warmup animations working
2. ðŸ“‹ Subagent initialization
3. ðŸ“‹ Session state persistence
4. ðŸ“‹ Clean error messages

### Nice to Have
1. ðŸ’¡ Auto-discovery of project commands
2. ðŸ’¡ Hot-reload for development
3. ðŸ’¡ Debug mode for troubleshooting
4. ðŸ’¡ Performance monitoring

## Technical Approach

### Option A: Direct MCP Registration
```javascript
// Register commands directly with MCP Server
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => ({
  tools: [
    {
      name: 'veria-start',
      description: 'Start Veria development session',
      inputSchema: { /* ... */ }
    }
  ]
}));
```

### Option B: DevAssist Extension
```javascript
// Extend DevAssist's command system
class ProjectCommands extends DevAssistCommands {
  constructor(projectName) {
    super();
    this.registerProjectCommands(projectName);
  }
}
```

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
```javascript
// Combine both methods for maximum compatibility
// Use DevAssist for functionality
// Use direct MCP for slash command registration
```

---

## Development Commands

### Start Development
```bash
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/devassist-isolation
npm init -y
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

### Test Server
```bash
# Test template server
node template/server.js --test

# Test in Veria project
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Veria
node .devassist/server.js --test
```

### Check Claude Config
```bash
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | jq '.mcpServers."veria-devassist"'
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# Watch Claude logs for errors
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/*.log
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Commands don't appear as slash commands
**Potential Solutions**:
1. Ensure proper tool registration with MCP
2. Check if inputSchema is correctly formatted
3. Verify server is actually running
4. Restart Claude Code completely

### Issue: DevAssist functions not available
**Potential Solutions**:
1. Import DevAssist before setting project env vars
2. Ensure proper module resolution
3. Check for circular dependencies
4. Verify paths are absolute

### Issue: Data contamination between projects
**Potential Solutions**:
1. Use project-specific SQLite databases
2. Isolate environment variables properly
3. Create separate data directories
4. Implement proper cleanup

## Quick Test Checklist

Before considering Sprint 1 complete:

- [ ] Create template server that starts without errors
- [ ] Register at least one test command
- [ ] Command appears when typing "/" in Claude Code
- [ ] Command executes when selected
- [ ] DevAssist functions are accessible
- [ ] Data is isolated to project directory
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete
- [ ] Another developer could replicate setup

---

## Next Steps After Sprint 1

1. **Sprint 2**: Apply template to Veria project
2. **Sprint 3**: Fix session management 
3. **Sprint 4**: Comprehensive testing
4. **Sprint 5**: Deploy to all projects
