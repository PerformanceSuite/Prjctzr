## 🔬 Advanced Features Implemented

### 1. DevAssist Environment Injection
```javascript
// Clean integration without modifying main DevAssist
process.env.PROJECT_ROOT = projectPath;
process.env.DEVASSIST_PROJECT = projectName;
process.env.DEVASSIST_ISOLATED = 'true';

// DevAssist loads with project context
const devassist = await loadDevAssist();
```

### 2. Semantic Vector Memory
```javascript
// Vector-based similarity search with project isolation
const results = await memory.semanticSearch(query, {
  category: 'regulatory',  // Project-specific categories
  includeContext: true,    // Rich contextual information
  minSimilarity: 0.7      // Relevance threshold
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Session Lifecycle
```javascript
// Full session management with warmup and cleanup
const session = await sessionManager.startSession({
  loadContext: true,        // Previous session restoration
  loadBlockchain: true,     // Project-specific context
  showWarmup: true         // Visual progress indicators
});
```

### 4. Project-Specific Subagents
```javascript
// Veria gets specialized subagents
const veriSubagents = [
  { name: 'compliance-officer', purpose: 'Regulatory monitoring' },
  { name: 'blockchain-specialist', purpose: 'Smart contract expertise' },
  { name: 'token-economist', purpose: 'Tokenomics modeling' }
