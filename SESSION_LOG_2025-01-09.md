# Session Log - January 9, 2025

## Session Context
**Time:** 02:30 AM PST  
**Project:** PROJECT_SETUP  
**Issue:** DevAssist MCP server configuration error preventing session management

## Problem Identified

### Error Message
```
Error: MCP error -32603: no such column: embedding_id
```

This error occurred when trying to use DevAssist session commands (`/session-start`, etc.) in the PROJECT_SETUP directory.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Incorrect MCP Configuration**: The `.mcp.json` file was misconfigured, pointing to DevAssist instances in subdirectories rather than the main project's DevAssist instance.

2. **Wrong Server File Reference**: The configuration was looking for `server.js` but the actual file was named `project_setup-server.js`.

## Issues Found

### 1. `.mcp.json` Configuration (BEFORE)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devassist-testproject": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/test-project/.devassist/server.js"
      ]
    },
    "devassist-veria": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/veria-project/.devassist/server.js"
      ]
    },
    "devassist-veria-enhanced": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/veria-project/.devassist/server-enhanced.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Actual DevAssist Structure
- DevAssist data exists at: `.devassist/data/`
- Server file actually named: `.devassist/project_setup-server.js`
- Terminal logs directory exists but empty: `.devassist/terminal_logs/`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Corrected `.mcp.json` Configuration (AFTER)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devassist-project-setup": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/.devassist/project_setup-server.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Key Changes Made
- Removed references to subdirectory DevAssist instances
- Added correct reference to PROJECT_SETUP's own DevAssist instance
- Fixed server filename from `server.js` to `project_setup-server.js`
- Named the server `devassist-project-setup` for clarity

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Action Needed
1. **Restart Claude Code** - This is required to load the new MCP configuration
2. After restart, test `/session-start` command
3. Verify DevAssist is working correctly

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Claude Code restarted
- [ ] `/session-start` works without errors
- [ ] DevAssist project memory accessible
- [ ] Session management functional

## Project State Summary

### Working Components
- DevAssist database exists at `.devassist/data/sqlite/default.db`
- Project structure properly initialized
- Sprint 1-5 completed successfully (based on SPRINT*_COMPLETE.md files)
- All necessary directories created

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/.mcp.json` - Fixed MCP server configuration

### Current Project Structure
```
PROJECT_SETUP/
├── .devassist/
│   ├── project_setup-server.js  # Correct server file
│   ├── data/                     # Database directory

```

## Historical Context
- Previous session (Sept 4) was a brief test lasting 20 seconds
- System had completed 5 sprints of development
- The `/initproject` system was successfully tested across 5 different project types
- Performance metrics and testing were documented in SPRINT5_COMPLETE.md

## Resolution Status
✅ **FIXED** - Configuration corrected, awaiting Claude Code restart to activate
