# âœ… Sprint 1 Complete: Perfect Slash Commands

## Achievement Summary
Successfully implemented project-specific slash commands that generate automatically when running `/initproject`. Each project now gets its own unique command set like `/veria-start`, `/performia-end`, etc.

## What Was Built

### 1. Enhanced devassist-init Script
- Modified `/Users/danielconnolly/bin/devassist-init` 
- Now generates project-specific commands automatically
- Creates normalized project names (spaces/hyphens removed, lowercase)
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 2. Command Generation System
Created comprehensive command generation that produces:
- `{project}-start` - Full DevAssist session initialization
- `{project}-end` - Session cleanup with git operations
- `{project}-status` - Check current state
- `{project}-checkpoint` - Save progress
- `{project}-memory` - Search knowledge base
- `{project}-decision` - Record architectural decisions
- `{project}-sprint` - Heartbeat to prevent timeout

### 3. Testing Verification
Successfully tested with test project:
- Commands generated correctly
- Proper file structure created
- YAML frontmatter correct
- MCP function calls integrated

## Files Changed
1. `/Users/danielconnolly/bin/devassist-init` - Added project command generation
2. Created `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/generate-project-commands.sh` - Standalone generator

## How It Works Now

When someone runs `/initproject`:
1. Project name is detected and normalized
2. Seven project-specific commands are created
3. Commands appear in `.claude/commands/` directory
4. After Claude restart, commands available via `/`

Example for project "Veria":
- `/veria-start`
- `/veria-end`
- `/veria-status`
- `/veria-checkpoint`
- `/veria-memory`
- `/veria-decision`
- `/veria-sprint`

## Ready for Sprint 2
Foundation complete for autonomous session management. Next: heartbeat integration, subagent verification, and full automation.
