# üìÖ Upcoming Sprints - Simplified MVP Path

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2025  
**Current Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Active)  
**Total Sprints:** 5 (Reduced from 10)

---

## üéØ New Focus: MVP First, Enhancement Later

We're pivoting from a 10-sprint "perfect architecture" to a 5-sprint "working MVP" approach.

## üìä Revised Sprint Timeline

| Sprint | Focus | Duration | Dates | Primary Goal |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Sprint 1** | Core Implementation | 3 days | Jan 9-11 | Make `/initproject` work |
| **Sprint 2** | Basic Intelligence | 3 days | Jan 12-14 | Detect 3 project types |
| **Sprint 3** | Enhanced Detection | 3 days | Jan 15-17 | Add framework detection |
| **Sprint 4** | Polish & Testing | 3 days | Jan 18-20 | Production ready |
| **Sprint 5** | Advanced Features | 4 days | Jan 21-24 | Only if 1-4 complete |

---

## Sprint 2: Basic Intelligence
**Duration:** 3 days (Jan 12-14)  
**Prerequisite:** Sprint 1 complete

### Goals
- Add simple project type detection
- Support JavaScript, Python, Go projects
- Apply appropriate templates per type
- Zero configuration required

### Deliverables
- [ ] Language detection logic
- [ ] 3 project type templates
- [ ] Auto-configuration based on type
- [ ] Fallback for unknown types

### Test Criteria
```bash
# Test JS project
cd ~/react-app && /initproject
# Should detect: JavaScript/React

# Test Python project  
cd ~/django-app && /initproject
# Should detect: Python/Django

# Test unknown project
cd ~/rust-app && /initproject
# Should use: Generic template
```

## Sprint 3: Enhanced Detection
**Duration:** 3 days (Jan 15-17)  
**Prerequisite:** Sprint 2 complete

### Goals
- Detect specific frameworks (React, Vue, Django, Flask)
- Identify development tools (Docker, K8s)
- Load framework-specific context
- Performance under 2 seconds

### Deliverables
- [ ] Framework detection for JS (React, Vue, Angular)
- [ ] Framework detection for Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- [ ] Tool detection (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- [ ] Context loading per framework

### Test Criteria
```bash
# Accuracy test
./test-detection.sh
# Expected: > 90% framework detection accuracy

# Performance test
time /initproject
# Expected: < 2 seconds total time

# Context test
/session-start-[project]
# Expected: Framework-specific help available
```

## Sprint 4: Polish & Testing
**Duration:** 3 days (Jan 18-20)  
**Prerequisite:** Sprints 1-3 complete

### Goals
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage
- Performance optimization
- Production documentation

### Deliverables
- [ ] Error handling for all edge cases
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Installation guide

### Test Criteria
```bash
# Coverage test
npm test -- --coverage
# Expected: > 80% coverage

# Integration test
./run-integration-tests.sh
# Expected: All passing

# Error handling test
./test-edge-cases.sh
# Expected: Graceful failures
```

## Sprint 5: Advanced Features (Optional)
**Duration:** 4 days (Jan 21-24)  
**Prerequisite:** ALL previous sprints complete and stable

### Goals (Only if time permits)
- Simple subagent system
- Project history tracking
- Session continuity improvements
- Basic learning capabilities

### Deliverables
- [ ] Basic subagent framework (if feasible)
- [ ] Project usage tracking
- [ ] Improved session persistence
- [ ] Learning from patterns

### Test Criteria
- Only implement if Sprints 1-4 are fully complete
- Each feature must be independently testable
- No regression in basic functionality
- Clear value demonstration required

## üö® Critical Success Factors

### After Sprint 1
- **Must Have:** `/initproject` command works
- **Blocker Resolution:** All configuration issues fixed

### After Sprint 2
- **Must Have:** Basic project detection functional
- **Quality Gate:** 3 project types supported

### After Sprint 3
- **Must Have:** Framework detection working
- **Performance:** < 2 second initialization

### After Sprint 4
- **Must Have:** Production ready
- **Quality:** > 80% test coverage
- **Documentation:** Complete user guide

### After Sprint 5
- **Nice to Have:** Advanced features
- **Only If:** Previous sprints 100% complete

## üìù Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **Sprint 1 Failure**
   - Impact: Entire timeline blocked
   - Mitigation: Focus only on making it work, skip fancy features
   
2. **Detection Complexity**
   - Impact: Sprint 2-3 delays
   - Mitigation: Start with simple patterns, enhance gradually

3. **Testing Gaps**
   - Impact: Production issues
   - Mitigation: Test continuously, not just in Sprint 4

## üîÑ Daily Standup Questions

For each sprint day, answer:
1. What was completed yesterday?
2. What will be done today?
3. Are there any blockers?
4. Is the sprint goal still achievable?

## üìä Velocity Tracking

| Sprint | Planned Points | Actual Points | Completion % |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Sprint 1 | 10 | - | - |
| Sprint 2 | 12 | - | - |
| Sprint 3 | 15 | - | - |
| Sprint 4 | 10 | - | - |
| Sprint 5 | 8 | - | - |

**Next Update:** End of Sprint 1 (Jan 11)  
**Success Metric:** Working `/initproject` command
