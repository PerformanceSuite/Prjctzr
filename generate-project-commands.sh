# 1. Project-specific start command
create_command "start" \
    "Start ${PROJECT_NAME} session with DevAssist warmup and verification" \
"# üöÄ Starting ${PROJECT_NAME} Development Session

I'll start a comprehensive session for ${PROJECT_NAME} with full DevAssist integration.

## Session Initialization
1. **DevAssist Verification** - Checking project-specific MCP server
2. **Terminal Logging** - Starting session recording
3. **Context Loading** - Loading previous session knowledge
4. **Subagent Warmup** - Verifying all project subagents
5. **Heartbeat System** - Activating 5-minute engagement checks

\`\`\`bash
# Starting session with DevAssist
mcp__devassist__session-start --project \"${PROJECT_NAME}\"
\`\`\`

After initialization:
- Use \`.devassist/scripts/claude-project.sh\` for terminal logging
- Session heartbeat will keep DevAssist engaged
- All work will be isolated to ${PROJECT_NAME}
- Previous context automatically loaded"

# 2. Project-specific end command
create_command "end" \
    "End ${PROJECT_NAME} session with git operations and cleanup" \
"# üèÅ Ending ${PROJECT_NAME} Development Session

I'll properly close the ${PROJECT_NAME} session with full cleanup and knowledge preservation.

## Session Closure Steps
1. **Knowledge Preservation** - Saving session insights
2. **Git Commit** - Auto-committing changes with intelligent message
3. **Terminal Log** - Finalizing session recording
4. **Cleanup Agent** - Removing temporary files
5. **Summary Generation** - Creating session summary

\`\`\`bash
# Ending session with cleanup
mcp__devassist__session-end --project \"${PROJECT_NAME}\"
\`\`\`

This will:
- Save all session knowledge to \`.devassist/data/\`
- Create git commit with session summary
- Archive terminal logs
- Clean up temporary files
- Generate PROJECT_SESSIONS.md entry"

# 3. Project-specific status command
create_command "status" \
    "Check ${PROJECT_NAME} session and DevAssist status" \
"# üìä ${PROJECT_NAME} Session Status

Checking current session and DevAssist status for ${PROJECT_NAME}.

\`\`\`bash
mcp__devassist__session-status --project \"${PROJECT_NAME}\"
\`\`\`

This shows:
- Active session information
- DevAssist connection status
- Subagent verification
- Recent checkpoints
- Terminal log status
- Knowledge base statistics"

# 4. Project-specific checkpoint command
create_command "checkpoint" \
    "Save ${PROJECT_NAME} progress checkpoint" \
"# üíæ Creating ${PROJECT_NAME} Checkpoint

Saving a progress checkpoint for the current ${PROJECT_NAME} session.

\`\`\`bash
mcp__devassist__session_checkpoint --summary \"Progress checkpoint for ${PROJECT_NAME}\"
\`\`\`

Checkpoint includes:
- Current timestamp
- Git changes summary
- Work completed so far
- Next planned steps
- Session state preservation"

# 5. Project-specific memory search command
create_command "memory" \
    "Search ${PROJECT_NAME} knowledge base and decisions" \
"# üß† Searching ${PROJECT_NAME} Memory

I'll search the project knowledge base for relevant information.

\`\`\`bash
mcp__devassist__semantic_search --project \"${PROJECT_NAME}\" --query \"<your search query>\"
\`\`\`

This searches:
- Architectural decisions
- Code patterns
- Session summaries
- Documentation
- Previous implementations"

# 6. Project-specific decision command
create_command "decision" \
    "Record architectural decision for ${PROJECT_NAME}" \
"# üìù Recording ${PROJECT_NAME} Architectural Decision

I'll record an architectural decision for the ${PROJECT_NAME} project.

\`\`\`bash
mcp__devassist__record_architectural_decision \\
    --project \"${PROJECT_NAME}\" \\
    --decision \"<decision made>\" \\
    --context \"<reasoning and context>\" \\
    --alternatives \"<alternatives considered>\" \\
    --impact \"<expected impact>\"
\`\`\`

This captures:
- Decision details
- Context and reasoning
- Alternatives considered
- Expected impact
- Timestamp and author"

# 7. Project-specific sprint check (heartbeat)
create_command "sprint" \
    "Quick ${PROJECT_NAME} sprint check (keeps DevAssist engaged)" \
"# ‚ö° ${PROJECT_NAME} Sprint Check

Quick progress check to keep DevAssist engaged and maintain session momentum.

\`\`\`bash
mcp__devassist__sprint-check --message \"Continuing work on ${PROJECT_NAME}\"
\`\`\`

This heartbeat:
- Keeps DevAssist connection active
- Prevents session timeout
- Updates progress tracking
- Maintains context awareness"
