## Prjctzr - Intelligent Project Initialization System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Status:** In Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Prjctzr (Projectizer) is a comprehensive project initialization and management system that provides intelligent, isolated AI assistance for software development projects. The system automatically detects project types, loads appropriate tools, and maintains complete isolation between projects to prevent context contamination.

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional project templates or generic AI assistants, Prjctzr creates a truly isolated, project-aware AI environment that adapts to each project's specific needs without manual configuration.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Context Contamination**: AI assistants mix knowledge between projects
2. **Manual Configuration**: Developers must manually configure tools for each project type
3. **Lost Context**: Session knowledge disappears between work sessions
4. **Generic Assistance**: AI provides generic help instead of project-specific guidance
5. **Repetitive Setup**: Same initialization steps repeated for every project

### Target Users
- Software developers working on multiple projects
- Development teams needing consistent project setup
- Organizations requiring isolated AI assistance per project
- Developers using Claude Code for AI-assisted development

## 3. Solution Overview

### Core Capabilities
1. **One-Command Setup**: Single `/initproject` command configures everything
2. **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies project type and requirements
3. **Complete Isolation**: Each project gets its own AI instance with separate memory
4. **Session Persistence**: Knowledge accumulates and persists across sessions
5. **Intelligent Subagents**: Specialized assistants load based on project needs
