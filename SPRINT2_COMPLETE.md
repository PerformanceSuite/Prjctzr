# ✅ Sprint 2 Complete: Autonomous Session Management

## Achievement Summary
Successfully implemented fully autonomous session management with heartbeat integration, subagent verification, warmup animations, and continuous summaries. Sessions now run completely autonomously with crash recovery.

## What Was Built

### 1. Enhanced Session Manager (`enhanced-session.js`)
Complete session management system with:
- **Heartbeat System**: 5-minute intervals to keep DevAssist engaged
- **Warmup Sequence**: Animated progress bars showing initialization
- **Subagent Verification**: Auto-creates missing agents based on project type
- **Crash Recovery**: Handles incomplete sessions gracefully
- **Continuous Summaries**: PROJECT_SESSIONS.md with latest entries on top
- **Terminal Log Analysis**: Loads previous context on start
- **Sprint Check**: Manual heartbeat to reset timer

### 2. Intelligent Subagent Detection
System detects and creates subagents based on:
- React projects → react-optimizer agent
- API projects → api-tester agent  
- Blockchain projects → blockchain-auditor agent
- Compliance projects → compliance-checker agent
- All projects → cleanup and warmup agents

### 3. Session Lifecycle Automation
Complete flow from start to end:
```bash
node .devassist/scripts/enhanced-session.js start  # Full warmup
node .devassist/scripts/enhanced-session.js sprint # Heartbeat
node .devassist/scripts/enhanced-session.js end    # Cleanup & git
```

### 4. Integration with Project Commands
Updated all project-specific commands to use enhanced session:
- `/{project}-start` → Runs enhanced session with warmup
- `/{project}-end` → Full cleanup with git operations
- `/{project}-sprint` → Manual heartbeat pulse
- `/{project}-status` → Check session state

## Testing Results

Successfully tested with `test-enhanced-session`:
```
✅ Session Started Successfully!
  • ID: 2025-09-05T00-10-24-101Z  
  • Heartbeat: Active (5-min)
  • Use sprint-check to keep engaged
```

Features verified:
- ✅ Warmup sequence with progress indicators
- ✅ Subagent creation (cleanup agent)
- ✅ Heartbeat started automatically
- ✅ Session file created in .sessions/
- ✅ Previous context loading

## Files Modified/Created
1. Created `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/PROJECT_SETUP/enhanced-session-manager.js` - Full implementation
2. Updated `/Users/danielconnolly/bin/devassist-init` - Integrated enhanced session
3. Modified project commands to use enhanced session manager

## Key Features Implemented

### Heartbeat System
- Automatic 5-minute intervals
- Manual sprint-check to reset timer
- Prevents DevAssist timeout during long sessions
- Random reminders (commit, test, document, etc.)

### Subagent Management
- Auto-detects project type
- Creates appropriate agents
- Templates for different agent types
- Verifies on every session start

### Session Recovery
- Detects crashed sessions
- Archives incomplete sessions
- Loads previous context
- Maintains session continuity

### Continuous Summaries
- PROJECT_SESSIONS.md file
- Latest entries on top
- Session duration tracking
- Automatic git integration

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- [x] Session starts with full warmup and verification
- [x] Heartbeat keeps DevAssist engaged during long sessions
- [x] Previous context loads automatically
- [x] Subagents created as needed
- [x] Crash recovery implemented
- [x] Terminal log analysis on start
- [x] Continuous summary file system
- [x] Sprint-check heartbeat command

## Ready for Sprint 3
Foundation complete for Git integration and cleanup. Next: automatic git commits, intelligent messages, and comprehensive cleanup routines.
